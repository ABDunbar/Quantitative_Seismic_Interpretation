# Quantitative Seismic Interpretation
## Rock Physics via Avseth et al and SEG

This is my adaptation of the work done by the SEG Tutorials, which also uses work from the book, Quantitative Seismic Interpretation (Avseth et al).

This is so I can do rock physics work without needing specialised software.

Work in progress...
